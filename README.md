# Facial-Recognition-with-Machine-Learning
Application of linear regression using basic machine learning algorithms like gradient descent. Given a photo of someones face the program can determine whether or not it is the face it was trained on. I trained it on my face and it worked well at distinguishing me from others. However, I am not comfortable with uploadling the pictures of me, my friends, and my family, that I used to train the algorithm.
