# Facial-Recognition-with-Machine-Learning
Application of linear regression using basic machine learning algorithms like gradient descent. Given a photo of someones face the program can determine whether or not it is the face it was trained on. (In this case it distinguishes my face from others since thats the data I trained it on).
